MovieMeter API
==============

Author: Stuart Boston (Omertron AT Gmail DOT com)

This API uses the [MovieMeter.nl API](http://wiki.moviemeter.nl/index.php/API)

Originally written for use by Yet Another Movie Jukebox [(YAMJ)](http://code.google.com/p/moviejukebox/)

But anyone can use it for other projects as well.

Project Logging
---------------
This project uses [SLF4J](http://www.slf4j.org) to abstract the logging in the project.

To use the logging in your own project you should add one of the bindings listed [HERE](http://www.slf4j.org/manual.html#swapping)
